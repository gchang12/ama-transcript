HOW TO RUN
===
- chmod u+x compile-transcript.sh
- ./compile-transcript.sh

_User may optionally copy the "./notes/qa-contents.tar" file into the "./src" before hand to save time and resources; this results in erroneous ordering, though_

Note
===
The scraper method doesn't work anymore, since Reddit did some renovations and junk. I plan to update this someday.
