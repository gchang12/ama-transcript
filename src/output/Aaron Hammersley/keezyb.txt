After the severing stone, were Star and Marco just pretending that it worked? Do they still remember the moment they fell in love?

The severing stone did break the curse of the blood moon, but the reality is that the blood moon was not why Star and Marco liked each other. They were already developing feelings regardless of the blood moon. Breaking the curse, however, allowed them both to realize that their feelings had nothing to do with the blood moon.
