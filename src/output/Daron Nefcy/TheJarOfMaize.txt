Hi Everyone!
In the season 3 finale "Conquer", why did Meteora turn into a baby and lose her memories when hit by Black Velvet Inferno? The force of the attack and the moment aftet Eclipsa used the spell imply that the spell should have killed Meteora.

Eclipsa wanted to give Meteora a second chance. For a moment she didn't know if the spell would work. It was a desperate spell that could have easily killed her, but the results were just what Eclipsa wanted
