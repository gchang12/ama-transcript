Hello everyone, and thank you for taking time to do this!
Daron, When you're sketching down an idea, what makes it stand out as something you want to work more with? Is it just a gut feeling once it's jotted down, or do you go into it hoping to create something new and exciting?
Adam,
Do you have any specific episodes or takes of Star that you remember being most excited to see the final product of? I have to imagine it can be a long wait if you're particularly proud of a specific take. Is there any type of scene you haven't voiced yet that you'd still like to be able to try out some day?
Dominic,
What is the most exciting part of the process for you? And what is something difficult about it that people might not realize?
Thank you again everyone!

Sometimes episodes are really easy to write and sometimes they are hard. Some of the hardest are when we need to get a plot point into an episode and find a story that works around it and not have it feel shoved in or anything. I really love having very different episodes and not follow a formula. It makes writing more difficult, but more interesting I think. The most exciting part of the process for me is working with a team! I was so grateful for my team on Star! A lot of people on the show became my really good friends. Running a show is really difficult. You have to be a leader of a big team. There is always a certain amount of drama to deal with because of that.
