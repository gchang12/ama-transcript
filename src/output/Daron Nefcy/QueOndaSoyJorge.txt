513/5000Hello DaronMy questions would be:
1. Do you still have plans with Star Vs The Forces Of Evil? I mean there could be a possible movie or a book that shows us what happened after the end?
2. Did you really plan for the series to last longer than you were allowed to do?
3. Would you like to do a Spin-oof of the series with Metero and Mariposa as protagonists?4.Tom's powers were affected by destroying the magic?
4. What do you think of tom and janna's ship?
5. Could we see Star and Marco's wedding someday?
I send you a huge greeting and a hug and thank you for creating Star Vs The Forces of Evil and getting closer with their characters and their adventures
Success for you
Your fan: Jorgeluis

1. I would love to! Keep asking for it and maybe one day it’ll happen. Hate it keep saying it, but I can’t just decide to do it. The studio needs to feel like the show is popular enough to warrant it. Or even just that there is a need to make it.  2) This is a little bit of a complicated question! I was very lucky to get 4 seasons. For a variety of very boring reasons, most animated shows for kids only get about two or three seasons, max. So, I feel very lucky I got to do 4 on Star. When our 4th season got approved I knew that would most likely be the end, just because of the rarity of having a 4th season. So, I wrote an ending. I was really happy with the ending. I know a lot of fans thought it felt rushed, but I think that just means you want more. I would love to do more with Star someday. Obviously, that decision is not one I can just make. But if the powers that be wanted to make more Star I would love to work with them again.
