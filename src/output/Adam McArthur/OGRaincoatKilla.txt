Are there any further details about Dave Lucitor and the wider Lucitor family youâ€™d be willing to share? Is Dave a Butterfly family relative whose marriage is what formed the alliance between Mewni and the Underworld, did they meet under more natural circumstances, is he not a Mewman at all?
Thank you for your time.

Dave was just a regular old Mewman who worked as a Barista at the coffee shop Lady Lucitor frequented. She tipped well and he fell in love. The end.
