OK, I am really bad at greeting people but hello anyway!
I have a few pretty negligible question here:
1. Since one minute is equal to two years in Hekapoo's dimension, which means time there runs more than a million time faster, does this mean she can be nearly as old as Glossaryck?
2. So, Brunzetta is like a goddess of thunder, right? (She can teleport, use power of lighting, and live for like millions of years) Is Hekapoo or the MHC aware of her existence? She's a really powerful being with magical-like powers.
3. Are all of her powers gone with magic? Does that mean she will die like Mother Gothel in Rapunzel?

1. Yes
2. Yes. They have no idea about her.
3. To be determined....
