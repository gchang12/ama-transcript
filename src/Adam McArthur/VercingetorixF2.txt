To Daron:
1. What were Issues 5-8/ending of Deep Trouble going to be like?
2. Originally, you planned on pitching a 22th Episode for Season 3 if Season 4 was not greenlit. What was this episode gonna be like?
3. What is your favorite Kyoani anime?
To Adam: Do you read the My Hero Academia manga? If so, are you caught up?

I don't read the Manga! I'm caught up on the series and am super excited for season 4! I've heard some crazy stuff goes down - I cannot WAIT > My Hero
