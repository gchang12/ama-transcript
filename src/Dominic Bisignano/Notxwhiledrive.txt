Any regrets about the show? Anything you would've changed in retrospect? Linger in this sub for a while and oh boy, you will see lot of things we would change.
Also what time period was the First mewman from? Their attire seems to indicate pilgrims from the mayflower settlers but the timeline does not work out, and they emerged from the Earth Well in California a whole coast away from where they first landed
Thanks for doing this AMA and for SvTFOE! Its cheesy to say but this is the first cartoon that truly impacted me. I have made great strides from my art directly because of this show

This is a great question! Anything I would have changed in retrospect? Sure! It’s complex - I don’t think the stuff I’d change and what you’d change are in the same universe. I haven’t spent much time here, but from this AMA I can see that y’all have a lot things you’d like to see!
The stuff I’d do differently has more to do with I guess pushing to get Disney to embrace doing different kinds of episodes - slower episodes, episodes that explore character over the save the cat beats, and not putting jokes in for the sake of having jokes.
