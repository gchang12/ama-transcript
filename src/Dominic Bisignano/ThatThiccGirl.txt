Hello, everyone!
1. Since Omnitraxus Prime no longer exists, does this mean that the other alternate universes, no longer exist outside of the canon?
2. Did the guy that Star turned into a squirrel, ever change back to normal after magic was destroyed, or will he forever be that way?

1. No, the alternate universes are still there. Omni was just a middleman to accessing them. Good riddance! JK love you Omni ðŸ˜˜
2. Daron thinks he turned back, but he has the painful memory of having been a squirreltoad.
