Are Star and Marco going to get married and have children?
Why the decision to get rid of magic in the show?
Are Jackie and Star bisexual?
Is there any possibility of more content in the future?
What happened to Star’s outfit from the season 4 poster, why was she never seen wearing it in the show?

Star and Marco kids - maybe? I’d ask Star and Marco? What do you like/don’t you like about the possibility of them having kids?
Keep asking for more Star if you want more! Sign the change.org thingy :)
Getting rid of magic - we wanted to pay off the end of the Toffee story with Toffee having been right all along. It sort of kept him alive in a way that wouldn’t have been as satisfying if he was still around physically.
Bisexuality - maybe? I’d ask Janna and Star? Personally I’m more interested in your impressions and what you see in their relationship that resonates with you?
Star’s outfit - 🤷‍♀️
