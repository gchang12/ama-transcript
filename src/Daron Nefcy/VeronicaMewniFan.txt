In fact I have 4 questions:
1. Why did they decide to make an open ending (with the possibility of closing it with another story) and at the same time "throwing away" all the work (or history) that was behind?
2. In episode 4x20b) "The tavern at the end of the Multiverse" at a time Rhina the Riddled appears without her cheekmarks. Was this just a mistake when drawing or does it have any meaning?
3. Why did Starco affect such a degree that we ended up having the usual cliche of two friends who fall in love?
4. Do you have something planned to close the story?

1. My goal was to create a satisfying ending that still left room for more. I feel like it’s in the DNA of the universe to solve one problem but create another. That’s Star Butterfly! I know it may not have been satisfying for everyone, but I hope it inspires a lot of fan fiction and drawings. I didn’t want to solve everything and leave the fans nothing to play with! Plus, if I ever got to do more with Star I want something to play with.
2. Yes, that was a mistake. You have no idea how hard it is to keep everything consistent. I have made myself totally crazy at times trying to fix the little mistakes in every episode. It’s totally impossible to catch them all.
3. Not sure I understand the question.
4. Not at this time.
