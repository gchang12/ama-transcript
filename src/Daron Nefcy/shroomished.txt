Did your experiences in school affect how it was portrayed in the show? I know Marco was a successful student that ended up getting his GED

Yeah, I would say some of my high school experiences made it in. The GED one for sure! I actually didn't graduate high school. I was getting badly bullied so I took the GED test and left early. Best decision I ever made!
