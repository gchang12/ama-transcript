Yay, Daron is finally here. Got 2 questions.
1. Was Starco something that was always planned from the beginning, or did the fan reaction from the first season influenced it at all?
2. Was the monster arm planned to come back? The season 1 finale kind of hinted it, but nothing came from it.

1. I did have it planned for some timeâ€¦ I know some people got very into the shipping- which is cool! But I never intended for people to get so crazy. I wanted to treat them like real teenagers and their relationships as teenagers would.     2) To be honest we tried to write the Monster Arm return episode many times and we could never really get it to work! I believe it's still in Marco still might emerge someday.
